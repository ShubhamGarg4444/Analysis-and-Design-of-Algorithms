ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement
Given:
â€¢	An array p[] where p[i] is the profit of the i-th item
â€¢	An array w[] where w[i] is the weight of the i-th item
â€¢	An integer W representing the maximum capacity of the knapsack
Find the maximum profit that can be earned by selecting a subset of items such that:
â€¢	Each item is either taken once or not at all (0/1 Knapsack)
â€¢	The total weight of selected items is â‰¤ W

ðŸ“Š Approach
â€¢	Uses Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up Tabulation).
â€¢	Builds a 2D table K[n+1][W+1], where each entry K[i][j] stores:
Maximum profit achievable using the first i items with capacity j.
