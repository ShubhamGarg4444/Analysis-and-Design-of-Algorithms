ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement
Given:
â€¢	n cities
â€¢	A complete cost matrix dist[i][j] where dist[i][j] is the cost to travel from city i to city j

Task:
â€¢	Start from city 0
â€¢	Visit each other city exactly once
â€¢	Return to the starting city
â€¢	Minimize the total travel cost


ðŸ§  Approach
â€¢	Uses recursive function g(i, S):
o	i: current city
o	S: set of unvisited cities

â€¢	At each step:
o	Try all possible cities j in S
o	Calculate total cost of visiting j and solving subproblem g(j, S - {j})

â€¢	Uses memoization with map<pair<int, set<int>>, int> to cache already computed states and avoid recomputation.
