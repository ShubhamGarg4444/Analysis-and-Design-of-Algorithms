ðŸ“Œ Overview
This C++ program implements Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm, an efficient method for multiplying two square matrices. Strassen's algorithm reduces the time complexity of matrix multiplication from O(n^3) to approximately O(nlog2_7), making it much faster for large matrices compared to conventional methods. This is particularly useful when multiplying large matrices in computational science, computer graphics, and machine learning.


ðŸ§  How It Works
1.	Input Matrices: The program takes two square matrices A and B of size nÃ—n (where n is a power of 2, e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.).

2.	Recursive Splitting: The matrices are recursively divided into sub-matrices of smaller sizes until the base case (1x1 matrix) is reached.

3.	Seven Multiplications: Strassen's algorithm computes seven intermediate products by recursively multiplying and adding/subtracting the sub-matrices, as opposed to the traditional eight products in standard matrix multiplication.

4.	Combination of Results: After calculating the intermediate products, the results are combined to form the resulting matrix C=AÃ—B.

5.	Matrix Output: The resulting matrix C is printed after multiplication.
